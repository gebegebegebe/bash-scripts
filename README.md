# Personal bash scripts

Stored bash scripts used on my linux machine. Feel free to use any of the scripts in this repository!

## setup.bash

Simple script that automatically opens links on firefox when called.

To run, go to the directory where the script is located then use the following command:
```bash
bash setup.bash
```
I recommend putting this script in your home directory. I do this so that I can immediately call the
script after my laptop finishes booting.
